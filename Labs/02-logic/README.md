## úkol 3: 4-bit comparator

### VHDL architecture

```vhdl
entity comparator_2bit is
    port(
        a_i           : in  std_logic_vector(4 - 1 downto 0);
        b_i           : in  std_logic_vector(4 - 1 downto 0);


        -- COMPLETE THE ENTITY DECLARATION


	B_greater_A_o    : out std_logic;
        B_equals_A_o     : out std_logic;
        B_less_A_o       : out std_logic       -- B is less than A
    );
end entity comparator_2bit;

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Architecture body for 2-bit binary comparator
------------------------------------------------------------------------
architecture Behavioral of comparator_2bit is
begin
    B_less_A_o   <= '1' when (b_i < a_i) else '0';


    -- WRITE "GREATER" AND "EQUALS" ASSIGNMENTS HERE
    
    B_greater_A_o   <= '1' when (b_i > a_i) else '0';
    B_equals_A_o    <= '1' when (b_i = a_i) else '0';


end architecture Behavioral;

```

### VHDL stimulus process  (`design.vhd`)

```vhdl
    p_stimulus : process
    begin
        -- Report a note at the beginning of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process started" severity note;
